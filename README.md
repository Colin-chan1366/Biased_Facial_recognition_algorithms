## Computer vision: Are facial recognition algorithms biased?

We'll focus on computer vision and discuss how face detection algorithms are used in various policy settings. Our focus will be on biased predictions, and what can be done to address them. 

Our focus will be on biased predictions, and what can be done to address them by training your own model to detect faces using the FairFace dataset and evaluate whether your model's performance varies by the demographic characteristics of the person.
